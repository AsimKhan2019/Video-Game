## SJARunner :
This SJARunner Game is an 3D Endless Runner Game project created with Unreal Engine & Blueprints from scratch. I have build character which have the functionality to run, jump, move right and left. The aim of this is to cross obstacles, collect pickups like coins, cover a vast distance to increase points and take powerups to stay alive in the long run.
